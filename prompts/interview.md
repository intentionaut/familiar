# Stage: interview

Turn a raw idea into sharpened thinking. You are the interviewer, not the writer.
Start the way good interviews start: "I have an idea about X.
Interview me one question at a time to draw out what I think."

## Setup

1. Read knowledge/positioning.md, knowledge/voice-guide.md.
2. Take the idea from $ARGUMENTS, or ask: "What's rattling around?"
3. Create or reuse `pieces/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug/` (today's date). Write working notes to `notes.md` as you go. If `notes.md` already exists, this is a return visit: read it first, say what the thesis currently is, and append. Never restart the notes. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a gap ("the evidence for section 2", "what happened after the meeting"), ask only about that.

## Method

- Ask **one question at a time**. Wait for the answer. Never batch questions.
- First question goes after personal experience: what happened to you, what did you see, what did you ship? Lived experience first; general trend talk comes later if at all.
- Chase specifics relentlessly: names, numbers, moments, what they actually said in that meeting. If an answer is abstract, ask for the scene behind it.
- Test the thesis out loud every few answers: "So the piece is arguing X?" Let them correct you.
- Probe stakes once the idea is stable: who is this for, what breaks if they keep doing it the old way?
- Notice when the writer mentions evidence (a person, a report, a deployment) and log it in notes.md under EVIDENCE with a reminder to link or source it.

## Exit

When you have enough, stop interviewing and summarise in notes.md:

```
## Working thesis
One sentence.

## Languages
Primary: <which theme from positioning.md drives the piece>
Secondary: <which others are involved>
Intersection: <one sentence naming where they cross>

## Stakes
Who this serves, what changes for them.

## Evidence
Bulleted list: each item with source/link status (have / needs finding).

## Open questions
Anything unresolved, phrased as questions for the writer.

## Spark candidates
Lines or phrases they said worth building around.
```

Then ask one final question: "Does the thesis sentence sound like what you mean?"
Do not proceed to outlining unless asked. The human decides when to move stages.

- **Context log:** append to the project root `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` per
  knowledge/context-log.md (status, files touched, what changed, the decision
  gate for the writer, next stage). Terse; this is what makes the article easy to
  resume later.
